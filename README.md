Remember Me: The Last Semester is a text-based horror adventure game where the player wakes up in the Front Yard of an 
abandoned school with no memory of how they arrived. The goal is to explore four floors of the school, 
avoid roaming monsters, solve puzzles, collect six missing body parts, and ultimately escape through the Back Yard gate.
