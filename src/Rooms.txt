F1_5 | Cafeteria | You enter the cafeteria - a large open room full of tables and chairs. They've been scattered - someone left here in a hurry. In the midst of the mess is what looks like a ... right leg ..? | Enter F1_4: Lobby. | F1_4 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | Front Desk Lady | Right Leg

F2_1 | Broadcast Room | You walk into the broadcast room, the door clicking shut behind you a little too loudly. The air feels still, as though sound itself has been trapped inside. Old control panels and microphones sit in silence, coated in a thick layer of dust. There's a shiny HDMI cable. A red "ON AIR" sign flickers once and dies - yet you didn't touch anything. | Enter F2_6: Storage Room; F2_5: Study Room; F2_2: Nurse's Office. | F2_6 | F2_5 | F2_2 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | --- | HDMI cable
F2_2 | Nurse's Office | You quietly enter the nurse's office, half expecting to see someone lying on the bed. Strangely, it's empty. The cabinets are slightly ajar, the drawers have clearly been rummaged through - but they left behind a band-aid. The cloying scent of antiseptic lingers in the air, but it is faint. You notice a stain on the floor, but it is too dark to tell what it is. | Enter F2_1; Broadcast Room; F2_3: Club Room. | F2_1 | F2_3 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | Janitor | Band-Aid
F2_3 | Club Room | You push open the groaning door to clubroom. The room is a bona fide mess-crumpled sketches on the floor, paint splattered desks, and an abandoned project in the corner. Someone spent a lot of time here... and then they never came back. You feel like you're being watched. | Enter F2_2: Nurse's Office; F2_7: the Science Lab. | F2_2 | F2_7 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | --- | ---
F2_4 | Auditorium | You step into the vast auditorium, and a cold breeze rushes past you, though no windows are open. Rolling towards you is a flashlight. The stage looms ahead, empty, with the curtains slightly parted - as if inviting you to look closer. The silence here is deafening, interrupted only by the soft creak of a seat shifting on it's own. | Enter F2_6: Storage Room. | F2_6 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | Janitor | Flashlight
F2_5 | Study Room | This is the study room, and somehow it is too ... quiet?. The desks are perfectly aligned, the books are open, but the pages don't move. There's a note stuck to one of them. You notice your own reflection in the glass of a cabinet - and something else behind you, just for a second. | Enter EE_2: Elevator; F2_1: Broadcast Room; F2_4: Auditorium. | EE_2 | F2_1 | F2_4 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | Janitor | Note
F2_6 | Storage Room | As you pull open the storage room door the smell hits you; musty, old wood, and something faintly rotting. Shelves groan under the weight of forgotten equipment, tangled wires, and old supplies. Something shifts behind the boxes, just out of sight. | Input F2_4: Auditorium; F2_7: Science Lab; F2_1: Broadcast Room via the secret tunnel. | F2_4 | F2_7 | F2_1 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | Janitor | Torso
F2_7 | Science Lab | You step into the Science Lab and the fluorescent lights flicker to life with a buzz. Glass beakers line the shelves, some filled with murky fluids. Notes are scattered across the tables, some scribbled in frantic writing. One cabinet is locked, with deep scratches. | Enter F2_6: Storage Room; F2_3: Club Room | F2_6 | F2_3 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | Janitor | Note

F3_1 | Art Studio | The Art Studio. There are different pieces of artwork scattered across the room... On the back wall there's a large canvas and paintbrush that appears to show a blackish figure with red eyes and horns. At the bottom the words "we are all doomed" are written in a blood-red colour. | Input F3_3: Math Classroom; F3_6: Library. | F3_3 | F3_6 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | The Teacher | Paintbrush
F3_2 | Blood Pool | You have entered the Aquatic Center where students come to practice their swimming. Although that is unlikely to be happening as the liquid in the pool is a deep red and there are bloody footprints leading from the pool ladder. | Enter F3_8: Hallway. | F3_8 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | --- | Right Arm
F3_3 | Math Classroom | This is what used to be the mathematics classroom (there are abandoned equations on the board)... Getting closer to the board, you accidentally kick a calculator to the side. One of the equations looks odd. It says "Dean + Baseball Bat = Head" ... yeah what does that mean? | You can enter F3_1: Art Studio; F3_6: Library; F3_4: Teacher's Lounge | F3_1 | F3_6 | F3_4 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | The Teacher | Calculator
F3_4 | Teachers' Lounge | You have entered the Teachers' Lounge, teachers often come here to relax but after what happened it'll never be the same. You notice a couple band-aids on the dusty counter.

F3_5 | Computer Lab | All the lights are off except for one in the back, ominous. Under the light - with the brightness turned all the way up - is a computer with an HDMI cable slung across the screen proudly displaying the message: "Error: Player is destined to Die". | Enter F3_4: Teachers' Lounge; F3_6: Library; F3_8: Hallway | F3_4 | F3_6 | F3_8 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | The Teacher | HDMI Cable

F3_7 | Vice Principal's Secret Office | The door groans open to reveal a cramped, window-less chamber. Filing cabinets line the walls, their drawers half-open as though pried at in desperation. There's a single unopened water bottle on one of the filing cabinets. A faint metallic smell clings to the air - iron, old and sour. On the desk sits a heavy, metallic 32 oz Water Bottle and a single leather chair, turned away from you. You could swear you hear breathing, but the room is empty. | Enter F3_6: Library; F3_8: Hallway | The Teacher | 32 oz Water Bottle
F3_8 | Hallway F3 | You have entered the third floor hallway. It feels cold and eerie. Most of the lights aren't working, and the ones that are, are flickering. Slumped in a corner is the body of a student you vaguely remember and in the opposite one is a teacher's body - with no arms. | Enter EE_3: Elevator; F3_2: Blood Pool; F3_7: VP Secret Office; F3_6: Library; F3_5: Computer Lab; F3_4: Teachers' Lounge | EE_3 | F3_2 | F3_7 | F3_6 | F3_5 | F3_4 | --- | ---

F4_1 | Diablo Bano | You push open the sign-less door into what you assume is the girls bathroom (cause duh no urinals). There are satanic symbols, blood on the mirrors, and bloody handprints on the stall doors. There's a note stuck to one of the mirrors with blood, and a Band-Aid on the hand dryer. The lights flicker on and off as flies buzz uncomfortably near. | Enter F4_3: XL Janitor Closet | F4_3 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | The Dean | Band-Aid; Notes

F4_3 | XL Janitor Closet | The closet has candles strewn across the room, posters, notes and information plastered across the walls. Upon further inspection you realise the Janitor was not losing his mind as previously suspected. He was collecting information on all the monsters over the years. He has information on where they came from and what they are there for. On his tiny desk are more papers/Notes, a pair of Scissors, Flashlight, and Band-Aids. | Enter F4_9: Drama Class; F4_1: Diablo Bano; F4_5: Students Room | F4_9 | F4_1 | F4_5 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | The Dean | Band-Aid; Band-Aid; Flashlight; Scissors; Notes
F4_4 | Sin City Room | Umm, this room has an interesting decor choice. The walls are essentially covered with photos of actors from Las Vegas. They were obviously still in the process as there is a discarded pair of scissors and a stapler. | Enter F4_9: Drama Class; F4_7: Hallway; EE_4: Elevator | EE_4 | F4_9 | F4_7 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | --- | Scissors; Stapler
F4_5 | Student Room | Normally a clean, organised classroom wouldn't be weird - exceeept every single other room you've passed has been in disarray.

F4_6 | Fred's Body Part Laboratory | There are body part charts on the walls, medical examiner tools laying haphazardly, albeit clean. ...So yeah creepy. You walk over to Fred's desk and take stock of his open wallet - with a note sticking out of it - laptop, a pair of scissors and flashlight. | Enter F4_2: Lost Souls Room | F4_2 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | The Dean | Scissors; Flashlight; Notes
F4_7 | Hallway F4 | You have entered the fourth floor hallway. There's massive cobwebs taking over the  hallway. There are skulls and bones scattered across the hallway and you hope they are ridiculously early Halloween decorations and not real. The elevator doors gleam at the end of the hallway. | Enter F4_5: Student Rooms; F4_4: Sin City Room; EE_4: Elevator | F4_5 | F4_4 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | 0000 | --- | ---

F4_9 | Drama Class | You have entered the Drama room. It is a huge theatre that can seat 500 people. Large bright lights dangle from the ceiling thanks to the monster's destruction.
