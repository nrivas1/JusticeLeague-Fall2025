Exist?
"The front desk lady told me I wasn't in the system again...I even showed her my ID. she said it was fake. What do you call someone who exists but isn't counted?" - A.G.


A Shape?
"There's something in the school, a shape. It follows you, but only when you forget. I drew it once...Now it wont stop whispering. It says I'll be next. I think it's right..."


Where's everyone
"There used to be 6 of us. Then 5. Then 4. They keep saying it's just my imagination. but now I can't remember their names."


Waiting
"I bought two lunches today, like always. One for me, one for you. You never showed. You always said you hate cafeteria food. I guess I was easy to forget."


Failed
| LOGIN FAILED | USER DOES NOT EXIST She was logged in yesterday. The System even shows her activity. So why does it say she never existed? Why does the server list her status as: ERASED?


Mirror
"Do you remember what i said about Mirrors? That they don't show who you are-only who you're pretending not to be? When you look in it, what don't you want to see?"


Mannequin
"Why a mannequin? Because that's all I am now. Just pieces someone has to reassemble. but not all of me wants to be found."


It's over
"This is where I stopped being real. You said you'd meet me. I waited. He found me instead" - A.G.
